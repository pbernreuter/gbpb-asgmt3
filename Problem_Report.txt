WRITING AND READING FILES
-Problems occurred when writing and reading files with the formatting
- We found that the write and read used binary formatting so when sending and retrieving the data we 
didn't need to encode and decode the data

QUIT LOGIC IN CLIENT  
- Problems occurred in the while loops with how the program quit
- Our initial design used elif which we later changed to only an if so that when you type wuit it exits 
out of both for loops. In addition to this we also moved the placement of this if around.

REUSE OF CODE  
- We reused some code in the retrieve and store methods between the client and server side.
- We had to fix variable names while also making some miniscule adjustments to the code in order for it to 
function properly.
